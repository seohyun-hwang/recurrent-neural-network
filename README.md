PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS! <br>

<b>Description:</b> Artificial Neural Network in the C programming language; employs the ReLU and Softmax activation-functions. Does not rely on tools like Scikit-learn.<br>
<b>Practice mission:</b> understanding the underlying processes of neural networks, understanding the reason for the nature of current machine learning frameworks
