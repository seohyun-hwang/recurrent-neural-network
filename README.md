PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS! <br>
<b>Description:</b> Artificial Neural Network in the C programming language; employs the ReLU and Softmax activation-functions. Does not rely on tools like Scikit-learn.

<b>Implemented:</b> forward pass, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), Cross-Entropy Loss error-calculation, recurrent backpropagation<br>
<b>Yet to do:</b> fix traversal flaws, fix variable initializations<br>

Thank you for your attention.
