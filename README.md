PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS! <br>
Currently a full draft but never tested, thus cannot be considered complete.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Artificial Neural Network in the C programming language; employs the ReLU and Softmax activation-functions. Does not rely on tools like Scikit-learn.
<b>Practice mission: understanding the underlying processes of neural networks, understanding the reason for the nature of current machine learning frameworks

<b>Implemented:</b> forward pass, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), cross-entropy-loss error-calculation, recurrent backpropagation<br>
<b>Yet to do:</b> fix bugs, test program with real data, set up a function that evaluates the model on test-data<br>

Thank you for your attention.
